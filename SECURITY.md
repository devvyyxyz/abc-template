# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please follow these steps so we can address it promptly and privately:

1. Use GitHub Security Advisories (recommended):
   - Go to this repository → Security → Advisories and create a new private advisory.
   - Attach a patch or reproduction steps and mark the severity.

2. If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, email the maintainers directly at `SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL` (replace this placeholder with the appropriate address).

3. After a fix is ready, the maintainers will coordinate disclosure and release a patched version.

Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities — use a private advisory or direct email instead.
